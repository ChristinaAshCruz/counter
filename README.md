# Counter

### *Java Assignment*

### Summary:

For this assignment, we are keeping track of how many times the same visitor visits a certain page. Iâ€™m set to create a basic counter that interacts with two pages (in which, one will show how many times someone has visited the other).

### Focus:

- Practice using session to store data
- be able to check whether a session variable exists
- use dependency injection to initialize session
- use `getAttribute` and `setAttribute` to read and modify session
